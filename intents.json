                "* *Subsidence:* Subsidence is the sinking of the ground surface due to the extraction of coal from underground. This can cause damage to buildings and infrastructure, and can also lead to flooding.\n* *Water pollution:* Coal mining can pollute water sources through the leaching of chemicals from the coal seams into groundwater. This can contaminate drinking water and make it unsafe for human consumption.\n* *Air pollution:* Coal mining operations can release harmful pollutants into the air, including particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides. These pollutants can cause respiratory problems and other health issues.\n* *Land degradation:* Coal mining can cause land degradation through the removal of vegetation and the creation of open pits. This can lead to soil erosion and the loss of biodiversity.\n* *Social impacts:* Coal mining can have a negative impact on the social fabric of communities, including through the displacement of people from their homes, the disruption of livelihoods, and the increased risk of accidents.\n\nThese are just some of the major problems associated with coal mining in India. It is important to be aware of these issues when considering the future of coal mining in the country."

The rules aim to improve the transparency and efficiency of the coal sector, and to ensure that coal is mined in a sustainable manner.\n\nSome of the key changes in the new rules include:\n\n* **Increased transparency in the coal auction process.** The new rules require that all coal auctions be conducted through a transparent and competitive process. This will help to ensure that the coal is sold at a fair price, and that it is sold to the highest bidder.\n* **Improved environmental safeguards.** The new rules include a number of measures to improve the environmental safeguards for coal mining. These measures include requirements for environmental impact assessments, and for the rehabilitation of mined areas.\n* **Strengthened enforcement of the rules.** The new rules provide for stronger enforcement of the rules. This includes increased penalties for violations of the rules, and the establishment of a new Coal Mine Safety Authority to oversee the implementation of the rules.\n\nThe new rules are a significant step forward for the coal sector in India. They will help to improve the transparency, efficiency, and sustainability of the coal sector, and will help to ensure that coal is mined in a safe and environmentally responsible manner.\n\nHere are the links to the new rules:\n\n* [Coal Mines (Nationalisation) Amendment Rules, 2022](https://www.egazette.nic.in/WriteReadData/2022/161041.pdf)\n* [Coal Mines (Nationalisation) Rules, 1973](https://www.egazette.nic.in/WriteReadData/2022/161040.pdf)"
